Summary of Changes
------------------
- Added a '.' in Brian's e-mail address.

- Added some poor keywords

- Took out "that have been" before "generated by the environment" in the second sentence.  This fixed a single-word line at the end of the paragraph and pulled it up to 4 pages.

- Changed "reinforcement learning" to "our field" in first sentence of third paragraph so we're not saying reinforcement learning twice in same sentence

- Changed " \citep{rlbook}" to "~\citeyearpar{rlbook}" because we only need the year (authors names are deliberately given in the sentence)  and to be consistent with ~ before citations instead of space.

- Changed "(\citeyear{AWhiteThesis})" to "\citeyearpar{AWhiteThesis}"

- Changed "generates the rewards" to "generates the observations and rewards" in the sentence about the environment program

- I took out the periods in each footnote that ended in a url.  Not sure the right way to handle this, but the period looks like part of the url and will break all our urls.
