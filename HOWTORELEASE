Changlog can be automatically updated by having SVN2CL installed:
http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/

Before release, the changelog can be updated like:
svn2cl --group-by-day -i -o changelog.new.txt --reparagraph --separate-daylogs --authors=authors.xml --revision 703:HEAD

NOTES:
- Replace 703 with the revision of the latest release.  This will get you just the changes since then.

- Open changelog.new.txt.  Check it out, see if you like it. Then, copy it into ChangeLog, and title it with the current release name.  See ChangeLog to see what I mean.
