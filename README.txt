Getting Started
---------------
There are several make targets: 
      - rl-glue  <-- this will make the RL-Glue executable: ./RL-Glue/bin/RL_glue
      - examples <-- this will make C, Java, and Python examples in the ./Examples directory and subdirectories
      - all	 <-- rl-glue and examples

So, to get started, just type:
make all

Running your First Experiment
----------------------------

Mark - can you put some simple instructions in here.  Like "open 4 terminal windows, and navigate to blah places, and then run ./agent ./env ./rl-glue ./experiment <-- and this will start an experiment like blah.  Alternatively, try blah. Could you do this so that all of C, Python, Java environemnts, agents and benchmarks are covered?
