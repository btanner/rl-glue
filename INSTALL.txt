Since you have unzipped the folder, you are done!!! Congrats. The following describes how to get a quick demo of pipe communication up and running. 

In Examples, there are a few sample projects included with RL-Glue. Mines_DirectCall is an example of the direct connect approach, where all files must be written in C and compiled together. Mines_NetworkCall is an example of the socket connect approach, where all files can be written in different languages (though all the files in this sample are written in C again) and can be compiled separately. The agent, environment and experiment can all be compiled on different computers and connect via a network to run the experiment. The last example is the Mines_PythonCall, which provides an example of writing socketed code in different languages.

To run any of these experiments, just go into their their folder where their makefile is stored. In your terminal type make and the project will compile. If you compiled the DirectCall example, one executable titled RL_glue will appear. Run RL_glue by typing ./RL_glue into your terminal and the experiment will run. If you compiled with the Network example, four executables will appear: RL_glue, RL_agent, RL_environment, RL_experiment. Run RL_glue and then run the other executables in any order. Once all four have been run, the experiment will begin. 

To begin writing your own code, check out our DOC.txt for a pointer to the current documentation and examples page. Feel free to Experiment!
