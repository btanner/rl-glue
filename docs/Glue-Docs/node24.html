Agent End</A>
</H3>
In episode task the environment enters a terminal state that ends the episode. RL-Glue responds to the end of an episode by calling the agent_end function; passing the reward produced on the last transition to the agent and signaling the end of the current episode. The agent_end function usually performs a final learning update based on the last transition and any other end-of-episode routines, such as clearing eligibility traces. If the environment is non-episodic RL-Glue will not query agent_end.

<P>
The agent_end function does not receive the final observation from the environment. In many learning problems this is of no consequence because the agent does not make a decision in the terminal state. If, however, the agent were learning a model of the environment, information about the final transition would be important. In this case, it is recommended that the environment be augmented with a terminal state that has a reward of zero on the transition into it. This choice was made to keep the RL-Glue interface as minimal and light-weight as possible.
