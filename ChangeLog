	  Took out some extra complications from the makefile to build with
	  this simpler structure

	* [r713] Examples/Agent/C/makefile, Makefile: RL-Glue is decidedly
	  broken at this moment

2008-09-03  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r714] RL-Glue/src/C_TaskSpec_Parser.c: moved a definition of a
	  variable up to top of function to stop warning

	* [r715] RL-Glue/Build, RL-Glue/Build_cpp,
	  RL-Glue/RL_glue.makefile: getting rid of old build structure a
	  bit

	* [r716] RL-Glue/build, RL-Glue/build/C, RL-Glue/build/CPP:
	  creating new build structure

	* [r717] RL-Glue/RL_glue.makefile: added a clean target and
	  replaced some hard coded stuff with variables for C vs CPP build
	  directories

	* [r718] RL-Glue/RL_glue.makefile: updated the clean rule to get
	  rid of the binary

	* [r719] RL-Glue/Makefile, RL-Glue/RL_glue.makefile: Renamed the
	  RL_glue.makefile to Makefile. Why require the extra -f
	  RL_glue.makefile typing?

	* [r720] RL-Glue/Makefile: removed java and python from the
	  makefile

	* [r721] RL-Glue/Makefile: grammar correction to makefile

	* [r722] RL-Glue/Makefile: simplified RL-Glue makefile by making it
	  compiled the client files to, so that the agent/env/exp makefiles
	  won't have to hook into this one

	* [r723] RL-Glue/Makefile: Make all now compiles the RL_glue
	  executable and the client objects that are needed to make agents
	  and environments, but only C right now...

	* [r724] RL-Glue/Makefile: making a top level makefile here which
	  will call the sub makefile twice

	* [r725] RL-Glue/Makefile, RL-Glue/rl-glue.makefile: making a top
	  level makefile here which will call the sub makefile twice

	* [r726] RL-Glue/Makefile: Actually created the high level makefile

	* [r727] Examples/Agent/C/makefile, Examples/Agent/Java/makefile,
	  Examples/Agent/Python/makefile, Examples/Environment/C/makefile,
	  Examples/Environment/Java/makefile,
	  Examples/Environment/Python/makefile,
	  Examples/Experiment/C/makefile,
	  Examples/Experiment/Java/makefile,
	  Examples/Experiment/Python/makefile,
	  Examples/Glue_single_C_exe/Makefile, Makefile: updated not all of
	  the examples... just agent and environment C

2008-09-04  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r728] RL-Glue/src/RL_client_agent.c,
	  RL-Glue/src/RL_client_environment.c,
	  RL-Glue/src/RL_client_experiment.c: Taking the client_{agent,
	  environment, experiment} out of RL-Glue because they are the
	  C/C++ codecs

	* [r729] RL-Glue/rl-glue.makefile: Removed all references to the
	  client_{agent, environment, experiment} out of the makefile
	  because they are the C/C++ codecs

	* [r730] Examples, tmp, tmp/Agent, tmp/Environment, tmp/Experiment,
	  tmp/Glue_single_C_exe, tmp/Makefile, tmp/Run_scripts: making
	  examples lower case, it's a 2 step process

	* [r731] examples, tmp: making examples lower case, it's a 2 step
	  process

	* [r732] Utils: removing utils, they've been added to rl-glue-ext

	* [r733] examples/Agent/Java, examples/Agent/Python,
	  examples/Environment/Java, examples/Environment/Python,
	  examples/Experiment/Java, examples/Experiment/Python: removed all
	  the java and python examples

	* [r734] examples: removed all examples

	* [r735] RL-Glue/Makefile, RL-Glue/bin, RL-Glue/build,
	  RL-Glue/include, RL-Glue/rl-glue.makefile, RL-Glue/src, bin,
	  build, include, rl-glue.makefile, src, sub.makefile: moving stuff
	  out of subdirectory

	* [r736] Makefile, orig.main.makefile: shuffling the makefiles

	* [r737] Makefile, sub.makefile: shuffling the makefiles

2008-09-07  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r776] AUTHORS, ChangeLog, INSTALL, Makefile, Makefile.am,
	  Makefile.in, NEWS, README, README.txt, RL-Glue, aclocal.m4, bin,
	  bootstrap.sh, build, config, config/compile, config/config.guess,

	  src/RL_server_environment.c, src/RL_server_experiment.c,
	  src/rlglue, src/rlglue/Agent_common.h,
	  src/rlglue/Environment_common.h, src/rlglue/Experiment_common.h,
	  src/rlglue/RL_common.h: merged the automake branch with main
	  rl-glue

	* [r777] configure, configure.ac: updated the current versions to
	  be 3.0-beta

	* [r778] rlglue-3.0-beta.tar.gz: added beta to make it easier to
	  test on other machines

	* [r779] src/C_TaskSpec_Parser.c, src/RLStruct_util.c: removing C
	  files we don't need

	* [r780] AUTHORS, src/RL_network.h, src/rlglue/Agent_common.h,
	  src/rlglue/Environment_common.h, src/rlglue/Experiment_common.h,
	  src/rlglue/RL_common.h: updated the license to Apache from GPL in
	  some of the header files and added Matt Radkie to the AUTHORS
	  list.

	* [r781] src/RL_server_experiment.c: Removed AUTO_RECONNECT option
	  from RL-Glue standalone executable as per issue 59

	* [r782] src/RL_glue.c, src/RL_network.h, src/RL_server_agent.c,
	  src/RL_server_experiment.c, src/rlglue/Agent_common.h,
	  src/rlglue/Experiment_common.h: removed Agent_Freeze and
	  RL_Freeze from the project

	* [r783] src/RL_network_glue.c, src/RL_server_experiment.c: Changed
	  some of the status messages to print to stdout instead of stderr.
	  Fixed a bug that only pritned out the startup message when using
	  a non standard port. Updated the usage message to explain how to
	  change the default port (issue 8).

	* [r784] src/RL_server_experiment.c: Updated the usage message to
	  print the current version as well as the usage info

	* [r785] src/RL_glue.c: Cleaned up RL_glue.c as per issue issue 52.
	  Removed several global static variables and put them inside the
	  functions they were required for (last_observation, oa, roa,
	  last_terminal). Removed last_terminal actually, and instead made
	  RL_episode check the return value of RL_step. Removed
	  total_steps, it was accumulating numbers but was never returned.

	* [r786] src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/RL_glue.c,
	  src/rlglue/Experiment_common.h, src/rlglue/RL_common.h: added a
	  new typedef (unsigned int) for terminal. Made RL_episode return a
	  terminal. Initialized some structs in some functions to {0}.

	* [r787] src/RL_server_experiment.c: As per issue 39, RL_Episode
	  now returns whether the episode ended because of regular
	  termination or cutoff

	* [r788] src/RL_glue.c, src/RL_network_environment.c,
	  src/RL_server_experiment.c, src/rlglue/RL_common.h: I think I
	  updated the codec to correctly return whether RL_Episode
	  terminated by timeout or by natural episode completion as per
	  issue 39

	* [r789] src/RL_glue.c, src/RL_server_agent.c,
	  src/RL_server_experiment.c, src/rlglue/Experiment_common.h:
	  Updated the spec and code such that RL_init returns the task spec

2008-09-08  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r790] rlglue-3.0-beta.tar.gz, src/RL_glue.c, src/RL_network.c,
	  src/RL_network.h, src/RL_server_agent.c,
	  src/RL_server_environment.c, src/RL_server_experiment.c,
	  src/rlglue/Agent_common.h, src/rlglue/Environment_common.h,
	  src/rlglue/Experiment_common.h, src/rlglue/RL_common.h: Changed
	  all of the types to lower case and type_t as per issue 76. Not
	  closign it yet though

	* [r791] src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in: updated the makefile to
	  distribute rlglue/legacy_types.h

	* [r792] src/rlglue/legacy_types.h: oops, forgot to add
	  legacy_types.h to SVN

	* [r793] rlglue-3.0-beta.tar.gz, src/RL_network.c,
	  src/rlglue/RL_common.h: svn commit -m "Updated RL_common.h and
	  RL_network.c to accomodate a charArray addition to
	  rl_abstract_type_t (string observations) as per issue 74"

	* [r794] src/RL_network.c: Fixed small typo in RL_network.c that
	  was making string observations not get sent across (issue 74)

2008-09-09  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r795] Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	  src/RL_network.c, src/RL_network.h, src/RL_network_agent.c,
	  src/RL_network_environment.c, src/RL_network_experiment.c,
	  src/RL_network_glue.c, src/RL_server_agent.c,
	  src/RL_server_environment.c, src/RL_server_experiment.c,
	  src/rlglue/network, src/rlglue/network/RL_network.h: Changed
	  function name rlSwap to rlSwapEndianForDataOfSize, and created
	  the librlgluenetdev library with network.c in it, also moved
	  RL_network.h to rlglue/net/RL_network.h and made it distribute

	* [r796] src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in: We are now building
	  RL_network.c as a library, updated the Makefile template to link
	  against the library instead of recompiling those files

	* [r797] src/RL_direct_agent.c, src/RL_direct_environment.c,
	  src/RL_direct_experiment.c, src/RL_glue.c, src/RL_network.c,
	  src/RL_network_agent.c, src/RL_network_environment.c,
	  src/RL_network_experiment.c, src/RL_network_glue.c,
	  src/RL_server_agent.c, src/RL_server_environment.c,
	  src/RL_server_experiment.c, src/rlglue/network/RL_network.h:
	  updated copywrite on all c/h files to reflect best who worked on
	  them

2008-09-10  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r798] configure, configure.ac: Updated configure.ac to include
	  the build number in the version. We'll take this out for major
	  releases

2008-09-11  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r799] Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, tests,
	  tests/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.in,
	  tests/constant_environment.c, tests/echo_agent.c,
	  tests/experiment.c, tests/useful_functions.c,
	  tests/useful_functions.h: Added simple test suite. Make check
	  works, make distcheck works IF you've installed. Does not work
	  otherwise. Goign to try linux

	* [r800] Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure,
	  rlglue-3.0-beta.tar.gz, src/Makefile.in, tests/Makefile.in:
	  Latested updates (removed a distribution file and reran configure
	  on RLAI)

	* [r801] Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure, configure.ac,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/RL_server_experiment.c,
	  tests/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.in: Added some code to do the
	  subversion revisions even better. Now you can call svn_version()
	  and it will tell you the version in the code. Updated rl_glue
	  executable to print that out. Also I think I fixed the make
	  distcheck.

	* [r802] Makefile.am, configure, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.in, src/RL_glue.c, src/svn_dist_version: Finally get
	  the SVN stuff working 100% even on dist

2008-09-12  Brian Tanner <brian@tannerpages.com>

	* [r803] configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/svn_dist_version:
	  Couldn't make the SVN thing work no matter how hard I tried, it
	  fails distcheck because distcheck runs everything from _build so
	  the paths to svn_dist_version don't work.

	* [r804] src/RL_direct_agent.c, src/RL_direct_environment.c,
	  src/RL_direct_experiment.c, src/RL_glue.c, src/RL_network.c,

	  tests/experiment.c, tests/message_test_agent.c,
	  tests/message_test_environment.c,
	  tests/message_test_experiment.c: fixed up the basic tests and
	  added some pretty extensive message tests

	* [r810] src/RL_glue.c, tests/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.in,
	  tests/constant_environment.c, tests/rl_episode_test_experiment.c:
	  Added a test to make sure RL_episode is behaving, it is

	  tests/constant_environment.c, tests/echo_agent.c,
	  tests/experiment.c, tests/test1_enviroment.c,

	  tests/test_rl_episode_experiment.c,
	  tests/test_sanity_experiment.c, tests/useful_functions.c,
	  tests/useful_functions.h: Fixed a bunch of network bugs, updated
	  the test suite to match the C codec. Some of the tests are
	  broken, for a good reason, I'll make an issue

	* [r815] src/RL_glue.c: Addd some proxying to RL_env_message and
	  RL_agent_message so that nulls never get passed through, as per
	  issue 83. Need to do this for all of the functions though.

	* [r816] tests/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.in,
	  tests/test_seeds_environment.c, tests/test_seeds_experiment.c,
	  tests/useful_functions.c, tests/useful_functions.h: Added tests

	  tests/useful_functions.c: Added new test for empties and such and
	  set properties

	* [r821] tests/test_empty_environment.c: int wasn't declared as int
	  in a test, fixed a warning

	* [r822] tests/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.in: Fixed issue 87 where
	  we couldn't only build tests with make check

	  tests/test_sanity_experiment.c, tests/test_seeds_environment.c,
	  tests/test_seeds_experiment.c, tests/useful_functions.c: Moved to
	  autoheader system... everything should #include <config.h> and
	  defined SVN_VERSION which can be printed by the executable

	* [r824] config/config.h.in, config/stamp-h1: added config files to
	  change svn number

	* [r825] Makefile.in, config/stamp-h1, configure, configure.ac,

	  version in and to check if svnversion is installed in case its
	  not

	* [r826] configure.ac: Added new macro to correctly fetch the build
	  number and set it as SVN_VERSION

	* [r827] configure: checking how often it updates

	* [r828] Makefile.am, Makefile.in, config/saved_svn_version.txt:
	  Now have subversion information correctly going into the files
	  when they are built. yay.

	* [r829] config/saved_svn_version.txt, src/RL_server_experiment.c,
	  tests/test_1_experiment.c, tests/test_empty_experiment.c: rl_glue

	* [r831] config/saved_svn_version.txt,
	  src/rlglue/network/RL_network.h: Changed the retry interval from
	  10 seconds to 2

	* [r832] config/saved_svn_version.txt, src/RL_network_glue.c:
	  Changed print statements when components connect to glue to be
	  more verbose
